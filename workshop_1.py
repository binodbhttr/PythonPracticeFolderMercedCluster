# 2020 Python Programming Workshop - Day 1: Rock, Paper, Scissors!
# Made possible by Engineering Service Learning and the Solar Energy Association

# Welcome to the first Python programming workshop! This may be an exciting
# experience for you, especially if you've never programmed before. If you have
# any trouble at any time, then please ask for help.

# Prompt: create a "Rock, Paper, Scissors!" game in Python.
# These comments and some pre-written code will help you make your program.



# You don't need to worry about what this line of code does (for now). We will
# learn more about this in the future! Feel free to ignore it.

from lib.rock_paper_scissors import *



# When the player starts your program, they should be greeted with some kind of
# a welcoming message. Put that message here. Can you remember how we output
# data to the terminal?



# Now that we've greeted the player to our game, let's get their decision! We
# will ask them if they want to choose rock, paper, or scissors, and then we
# will get their input. Can you remember how we prompt and get input from the
# user?



# Now that we've gotten the user's decision, the computer needs to make a
# decision too. There is a special function I've made for you called
# computer_choice() that will make a choice for the computer. You can use this
# function I've made or you can try doing it yourself. You'll also want to
# output what they chose so that the user knows.



# Now that we have the user's choice ("rock", "paper", or "scissors") and we
# have the computer's choice ("rock", "paper", or "scissors"), then we can
# start computing the winner of the game! Can you think of a way to make
# comparisons and then execute certain code based off of that?



# That's all there is to making a rock paper scissors game! You should be very
# proud of yourself at this point if this was your first time programming.
# Now run your program, fix any bugs, and play a few rounds!
