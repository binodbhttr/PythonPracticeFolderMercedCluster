# 2020 Python Programming Workshops

This repository contains all of the materials needed for the 2020 Python Programming Workshops at the University of California, Merced, made possible through a partnership between Engineering Service Learning and the Solar Energy Association at UC Merced.

These workshops aim to teach the fundamentals of computer programming to beginners through a series of hands-on projects. Attendees are encouraged to focus on the **logic** behind these projects as opposed to being focused solely on the programming language itself.
